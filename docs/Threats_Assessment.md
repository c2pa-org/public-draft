# Threats Assessment

Information security is a principal concern of C2PA. C2PA maintains a threat model and security considerations for the C2PA specification. This effort complements other security-related work within C2PA. 

The C2PA is developing security considerations documentation that includes:

* A summary of relevant security features of C2PA technology
* Security considerations for practical use of C2PA technology
* Threats to C2PA technology and respective treatment of those threats, including countermeasures

The assessment is ongoing. For updated versions, please revisit this link in the future.
